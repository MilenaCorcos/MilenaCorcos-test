title: "Observation of Gravity Waves at the Tropical Tropopause Using Superpressure Balloons"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: '

    Tropical gravity wave activity is characterized from long-duration superpressure balloon flights

    Gravity-wave momentum fluxes exhibit a clear dependence to the distance to the nearest convective system

    Observed wave intermittency results from the time- and spatially-varying distribution of the source
